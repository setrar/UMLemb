    "## Description\n",
    "### Overall description\n",
    "\n",
    "A ground station needs to regularly monitor the safety data of a space-based system: 3D position, temperature, battery level, fuel quantity. For this, a ground station can send, via radio-frequencies, a TC (_TeleCommand_) to the space-based system. Once received by the RF receiver, the software of the space-based system gets the request for information. Data of TCs are ciphered. Once the software has deciphered data, it stores data in an intermediate buﬀer, and a task to handle this request is triggered. This task builds the answer by reading requested values from sensors. Once the answer packet has been built, it is first enciphered and then sent via a TM (_TeleMetry_) to the ground station, using the RF transmitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the system does not crash, a microcontroller of this system is dedicated to execute a software task that checks, every 10ms, that all other software tasks of the spacebased embedded system are still responsive. For this, a signal is sent to each task. If some of the tasks have not responded to this signal, then the whole system is restarted, apart from the watchdog: the latter is not expected to crash, apart if the battery is too low to power the microcontroller. Obviously, this watchdog task is of prime importance for this reliability of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, while the software system is computing a TM, another TC is received. To avoid redundancy, the TM under construction is canceled: a new TM corresponding to the latest TC is computed and sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, space-based systems are not well protected against high-energy particles. Such a particle can provoke a bit flip from 0 to 1, or the opposite. The memory is the most sensitive elements of the platform. Therefore, for each block of data the software writes into memory, an error correction code (CRC) of this block has to be computed by the software and stored into memory along with the data block. When this block is read, the corresponding CRC must also be read and checked."

    "1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The project models a communication system where a Ground Station exchanges TeleCommands (TCs) and Telemetry (TMs) with a Space-Based System, which monitors parameters like 3D position, temperature, battery level, and fuel quantity. Key features include fault recovery using a watchdog and data integrity through CRC checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "2.1 Communication\n",
    "\t•\tREQ-1.1: Process all received TCs.\n",
    "\t•\tREQ-1.2: Respond to TCs with a corresponding TM.\n",
    "\t•\tREQ-1.3: Cancel an ongoing TM if a new TC is received.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Reliability\n",
    "\t•\tREQ-2.1: Watchdog must monitor tasks every 10ms.\n",
    "\t•\tREQ-2.2: Restart system if tasks are unresponsive, excluding the watchdog.\n",
    "\t•\tREQ-2.3: Ensure watchdog operates as long as the battery is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 Data Integrity\n",
    "\t•\tREQ-3.1: Compute and store CRC for all data written to memory.\n",
    "\t•\tREQ-3.2: Validate CRC on memory read; handle errors if validation fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Key Artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1 System Components\n",
    "\t1.\tRF Receiver & Transmitter: Handle TCs and TMs.\n",
    "\t2.\tSensors: Monitor 3D position, temperature, battery, and fuel.\n",
    "\t3.\tWatchdog: Ensures task responsiveness and triggers system restarts.\n",
    "\t4.\tMemory with CRC: Provides data integrity against bit flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2 Behavior\n",
    "\t•\tNormal Workflow: TC → Decipher → Sensor Data Collection → TM Construction → Encipher → TM Transmission.\n",
    "\t•\tFault Handling: Task timeout detected by the watchdog → System restart → Normal operation resumes.\n",
    "\t•\tData Integrity: CRC computed during memory write and validated during read; errors trigger recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simulation and Verification\n",
    "\t•\tNominal Case: Every TC results in a TM unless preempted by another TC.\n",
    "\t•\tError Case: Memory bit flip triggers CRC failure → Watchdog restarts system → Operations recover.\n",
    "\t•\tVerified Properties:\n",
    "\t1.\tTCs always produce TMs (or are preempted by a newer TC).\n",
    "\t2.\tWatchdog ensures system recovery under faults.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The system satisfies its requirements for communication, reliability, and data integrity under nominal and fault scenarios. Future work can extend fault-tolerance mechanisms for simultaneous task failures."
