    "When a dangerous situation occurs that forces the driver, or the car itself, to perform a manoeuvre, this can endanger other vehicles. In order to warn other vehicles, the car sends out a warning message. Nearby cars that are in danger can then react according to the information provided within the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ECU of the chassis & safety domain detects a danger; this may be the trigger of an air- bag, an obstacle in direction of travel seen by an environmental sensor, or an emergency braking performed by the driver or an automatic system. The Chassis Safety Controller (CSC) gets information about the dangerous situation via the Chassis Domain Bus. The CSC will assess the situation and will take measures to mitigate the danger for the car. The measures will result in commands to actuator ECUs in the chassis & safety domain and additionally commands to the powertrain domain to get a helpful driving power adjustment. In parallel it will also send information to the Communication Unit (CU). This information will contain data about the current vehicle dynamic status and detailed information about the planned actions (deceleration or acceleration, steering, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The CU will send out a warning message that contains this information via the DSRC interface to nearby vehicles. The emergency message contains longitude, latitude, altitude, speed, acceleration and heading of the car, the time of message generation, the expiry time of the message, an indicator for the reliability of the information, a code that is classifying the car, an id that is identifying the sender of the message, an event code that is classifying the emergency situation and the planed acceleration and heading.
